""" Implements an example of Parallel (Concurrent) agents to run parallel search for
three different topics the combine them with an aggregator agent.

1- There is one agent for each topic and all run in parallel under a ParallelAgent.

2- The final result is combined in an aggregator agent as a SequentialAgent.
